This is a TCP chat in Python3.

It consists of Server and Client app.

Server has simple console commands like:

/h - prints command list
/f - upload file
/d - download file
/q - exit from chat

I've tested file transfering on a localhost only so I've used app's home path.

I wrote this app as my university project so I will be glad if this application will help someone.
